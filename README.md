# PUS
PUS is a CLI wrapper for usage of curl with the pb instance at https://ptpb.pw/, however it can easily be modified to work with a self-hosted instance of pb.
PUS can upload normal files, upload images (only PNGs at the moment, but the plan is to add support for more formats), take screenshots and upload them, and shorten URLs.
# Dependancies
