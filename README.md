# Pussy
Pussy is a CLI wrapper for usage of curl with the pb instance at https://ptpb.pw/, however it can easily be modified to work with a self-hosted instance of pb.
Pussy is named after a very limited  previous script of mine (never released) called "pus" that stood for "PbUploadScript".
Pussy can upload files, take screenshots and upload them, and shorten URLs.
